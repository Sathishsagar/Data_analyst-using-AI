File Upload Feature: Users can upload custom JSON files (converted from CSV), making the dashboard adaptable to different datasets.
Advantages:
Improved Data Accessibility: The JSON format ensures compatibility with web technologies, enabling the creation of a live, browser-based interactive dashboard.
Actionable Insights: The dashboard provides a clear visualization of sales trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
